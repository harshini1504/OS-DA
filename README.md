SCHEDULING ALGORITHM BASED ON SIMILARITY:
Resource Allocation and Similarity Analysis shows a way of organising the processors load in multi-processing context, taking into account the process’s similarity. For maximized performance of the today’s computing systems, proper resource management is important as it helps to make use of the available resources effectively. This problem is targeted in the project by providing smart approach for processes distribution among CPU cores depending of their resource demands and affinities.This process includes distributing processes over the available CPU cores and making sure that all important resources like the CPU time, memory and the others are well utilized. In contrast, similarity analysis forms a crucial component in process management as it determines how processes can be grouped into one cluster or core.This is a new technique in project management that seeks to compare processes on account of their resource requirements. It minimizes contestation and maximizes efficiencies by trying to find processes with identical resource requirements. These uniquely identified processes are included in the “allocation” strategy.
